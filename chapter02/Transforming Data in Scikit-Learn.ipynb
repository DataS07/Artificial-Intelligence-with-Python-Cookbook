The main technique covered was Bayesian inference using Gibbs Sampling, a technique that is now considered to be largely obsolete. We will use a different technique here, and we will have fun explaining some mechanics of human mate choices.

Talking about different pipeline implementations, the dask package has its own pipeline as well, which is compatible with dask objects."
